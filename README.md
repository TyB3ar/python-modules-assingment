This is my submission for the Module 4 Lesson 1 assignment on moudles! 

The main python script is where the function should be ran for testing. 

In the main script we can see the custom modules 'mood_responses' and 'text_utils' being imported and ran based on user input.
Initially, the user is asked to enter a single word describing the mood they are in. Based on that mood, the program prints out 
a custom statement based on the 'type' of mood entered. 

Afterwards, the program then asks the user to select an option to amend the word entered in for their mood, asking for options such as:
- Reversing the letters of the word
- Capitalizing the first letter of the word
- Completely uppercasing the word
- Completely lowercasing the word
- Extracting the vowels from the word and displaying a list of those vowels 

This is all meant to showcase my understanding of custom modules in python. Thank you!
